Data Visualization projects 



1]  Data Visualization python

This project showcases various data visualization techniques using multiple datasets. Implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, it employs libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas to create diverse plots that illustrate the underlying patterns and insights within the data. The notebook includes visualizations for datasets like the Iris flower dataset and others, allowing users to explore relationships between different variables effectively. Each section is designed to enhance understanding of data analysis and visualization principles, making it a practical resource for learners and practitioners alike.

2] Hardware dataviz python

This project focuses on analyzing hardware sales data to extract significant insights regarding suppliers, inventory, sales trends, pricing strategies, and product demand. Utilizing the hardwaredata.csv dataset from Kaggle, the analysis involved preprocessing steps such as removing missing values and converting categorical data into binary formats. Various visualization techniques were applied, including pie charts, bar charts, and scatter plots, to illustrate relationships within the data. Key findings revealed that Supplier A dominates in market share and inventory size, while Supplier B excels in sales volume despite a smaller market share. The project highlights critical correlations between pricing and sales, with screws identified as the top-selling product. Overall, this analysis provides valuable information for optimizing inventory management and pricing strategies within the hardware market.

3]  SNCorpdashboard

This is a PowerBI dashboard that Visualizes the Sales of SN Corportion it is an interactive dashboard which combines a variety of plots and charts to make understanding data very easy.The dashboard was cresated using a dataset I obtained during a course on PowerBI. 

4]  Knime

This project utilizes KNIMEâ€™s default Olympic Athletes dataset to perform data visualization and analysis. The dataset is split to answer various data-driven questions, and insights are presented through visualizations such as pie charts and bar graphs. The project aims to explore trends, distributions, and key patterns within the dataset, providing an intuitive understanding of Olympic athletes' statistics through graphical representations.
